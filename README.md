# Game-Adventure
In your HelloWorld.java file, you'll be creating a "Choose your own Adventure Game". You'll come up with your own story-based game for a user to play, with different outcomes based on their choices throughout the story.
```bash

You have been transported to the year 3433. You wake up and notice that you're no longer on Earth. Gravity feels different. It's dark outside and as you stand up, you realize you're outside... a house? 

Select one: [a] Walk towards the house or [b] call out to the house

>> a

You approach the house and walk up the stairs to the front door. You're about to knock when suddenly you notice the lights inside the house turn on.
```

Create a program that uses the Scanner for user input, and, depending on what the user selects, you change the output of the story. Use your knowledge of program control flow to create only three (3) distinct endings to your adventure story.

```bash
You fell off the cliff and plummeted to your death. Sorry... Press [y] to restart. 
---
You ate some berries and didn't die. Peeta is that you? Press [y] to play again.
---
The computer says you live on!
```
